# Lab17 Database Design

this lab took me around 2 hours to complete.  I had a bit of a Git-uation that needed attention, but I was able to sort it out.  I built
the lab from scratch using the blank MVC app, and I used yesterdays lab to help build todays.  I admit I wasn't fully sure about how I 
was supposed to include all the components of the tables until I got starting drawing out the tables and their relationships.  Then it
became fairly easy.
